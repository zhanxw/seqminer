    <jloup@gzip.org> and Mark Adler
    <madler@alumni.caltech.edu>(they wrote zlib and provide license
    so we include zlib source code), Julian Seward

    license we include bzip2 source codes) and Heng Li

Description: Integrate sequencing data (VCF) or meta-analysis results in R
Copyright: We have used the following software and made minimal
    necessary changes: Zlib, Jean-loup Gailly <jloup@gzip.org> and
    Mark Adler <madler@alumni.caltech.edu> (License:
    http://zlib.net/zlib_license.html). We have changed its source
    code to not include stdio.h, and explicitly includes unistd.h
    heade file; Bzip2, Julian Seward <jseward@bzip.org> (BSD
    license). We have renamed compress.c to bzCompress.c to avoid
    name collision with zlib.h, and its license files are renamed
    to bzip2.README and bzip2.LICENSE; Tabix, Heng Li
    <lh3@live.co.uk> (MIT license). We removed standard IO related
    functions, e.g. printf, fprintf ; also changed its un-safe
    pointer arithmetics.
